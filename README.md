## Build information
Full releases are marked as such in the release.
If a release contains the `alpha` tag, it is experimental and features and more have not been tested.

Releases containing the `beta` tag are mostly tested but could still be considered unstable.

Releases will be marked as stable if they're thought to run well after testing.
If a release is marked as unstable, it might not run well or produce bugs, for example, memory leaks

When a new build is released, it might take some time until the wiki is updated

Changelogs only contain the most important information,
and small one-line changes will not be included if they don't have a major effect on stability and/or performance
